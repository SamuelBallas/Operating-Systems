An OS deals with many important functions including memory management. 
The OS tracks what programs are using the primary memory and what parts of the primary memory are free. 
The OS determines how much memory a program will get when there are multiple programs running. 
The OS will also give or take  away memory to programs when the program makes a request for memory, or when the program stops running.
